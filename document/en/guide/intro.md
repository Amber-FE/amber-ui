#### about  

Amber-UI is a library of business components based on a pharmaceutical e-commerce platform.  

 

We used our development experience from multiple page reversions to follow internal design practices and tease out and remove frequently used components.  Greatly improve the development efficiency at the same time, but also easy to unify the overall page style, reduce some common logic errors.  And in the follow-up development activities of continuous optimization and iteration, so as to better meet the development needs of related products.  

 

Ambere-ui is still in its infancy, and there are still some imperfections.  As we continue to improve existing components, we will continue to accumulate more components to better meet usage and development needs.
